### 4.3 Exercises

#### 4.3.1

Below is a regular expression grammar containing only the symbols `a` and `b`. It uses `+` instead of the union operator `|` to avoid confusion with the vertical bar used as a metasymbol in the grammar:

```
rexpr -> rexpr + rterm | rterm
rterm -> rterm rfactor | rfactor
rfactor -> rfactor * | rprimary
rprimary -> a | b
```

1. Left factor this grammar.
2. Does left factoring make th egrammar suitable for top-down parsing?
3. After extracting the left common factor, eliminate the left recursion from the original grammar.
4. Is the resulting grammar suitable for top-down parsing?

**Solution:**

1. There is no left common factor.
2. The grammar is not suitable for top-down parsing.
3. Eliminating left recursion:
    ```
    rexpr -> rterm A
    A -> + rterm A | ε
    rterm -> rfactor B
    B -> rfactor B | ε
    rfactor -> rprimary C
    C -> * C | ε
    rprimary -> a | b
    ```
4. It is suitable.

4. Grammar from exercise 4.2.2-5
5. Grammar from exercise 4.2.2-7

**Solution:**

1. **Grammar:**
    ```
    S -> S S + | S S * | a
    ```
    1. Extract the left common factor:
        ```
        S -> S S A | a
        A -> + | *
        ```
    2. The grammar is not suitable.
    3. Eliminate left recursion:
        ```
        // Initial status
        1) S -> S S A | a
        2) A -> + | *

        // i = 1
        1) S -> a B
        2) B -> S A B | ε
        3) A -> + | *

        // i = 2, j = 1
        1) S -> a B
        2) B -> a B A B | ε
        3) A -> + | *

        // i = 3, j = 1~2
        // Nothing changed
        ```
    4. It is suitable.

2. **Grammar:**
    ```
    S -> 0 S 1 | 0 1
    ```
    1. Extract the left common factor:
        ```
        S -> 0 A
        A -> S 1 | 1
        ```
    2. The grammar is not suitable due to indirect left recursion.
    3. Eliminate left recursion:
        ```
        // Initial status
        1) S -> 0 A
        2) A -> S 1 | 1

        // i = 1
        // Nothing changed

        // i = 2, j = 1
        1) S -> 0 A
        2) A -> 0 A 1 | 1
        ```
    4. It is suitable.

3. **Grammar:**
    ```
    S -> S (S) S | ε
    ```
    1. There is no left common factor.
    2. The grammar is not suitable.
    3. Eliminate left recursion:
        ```
        // Initial status
        1) S -> S (S) S | ε

        // i = 1
        1) S -> A
        2) A -> (S) S A | ε

        // i = 2, j = 1
        // Nothing changed
        ```
    4. It is suitable.

4. **Grammar:**
    ```
    S -> (L) | a
    L -> L, S | S
    ```
    1. There is no left common factor.
    2. The grammar is not suitable.
    3. Eliminate left recursion:
        ```
        // Initial status
        1) S -> (L) | a
        2) L -> L, S | S

        // i = 1
        // Nothing changed

        // i = 2, j = 1
        1) S -> (L) | a
        2) L -> (L) A | a A
        3) A -> , S A | ε

        // i = 3, j = 1~2
        // Nothing changed
        ```
    4. It is suitable.

#### 4.3.3

The following grammar aims to eliminate the "dangling-else ambiguity" discussed in section 4.3.2:

```
stmt -> if expr then stmt
      | matchedStmt
matchedStmt -> if expr then matchedStmt else stmt
             | other
```

Explain why this grammar is still ambiguous.

**Solution:**

Consider the following code, where indentation indicates the hierarchical structure of the code:

```
if expr 
then 
    if expr 
    then matchedStmt 
    else
        if expr
        then matchedStmt
else stmt
```

This code can also be parsed as:

```
if expr 
then 
    if expr 
    then matchedStmt 
    else
        if expr
        then matchedStmt
        else stmt
```

Therefore, this is still an ambiguous grammar. The reason lies in the production `matchedStmt -> if expr then matchedStmt else stmt`, where the final `stmt`, if it contains an `else` statement, can be interpreted as belonging either to this `stmt` or to the containing `matchedStmt`.
